# CS425-MP2

This is implementation of a membership list. process.cpp is the main membership list implementation.

## How to compile and run our code
clone the repo first then compile `introducer.cpp` and `process.cpp` by
```
make
```
Introducer must go in first, and we selected first VM as introducer, so on VM1:
```
./introducer
./process
```
Then on other VMs, do:
```
./process
```
